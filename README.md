# Welcome to My Video Game Analytics Portfolio! ðŸŽ®ðŸ“Š
Dive into my journey to build a comprehensive, end-to-end analytics pipeline centered around the fascinating world of video games. This project explores publicly available video game data, leveraging modern data engineering and analytics tools to transform raw information into actionable insights.

## What You'll Find Here:

- API ETL Workflows: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from APIs like IGDB, RAWG, and other public sources, ensuring clean and structured datasets ready for analysis.
- Data Modeling: Designing efficient schemas to organize complex datasets, including video games metadata, player statistics, and ratings.
- Advanced Analytics: Uncovering trends and insights in the video game industry, from release patterns to pricing strategies and player preferences.
- Interactive Dashboards: Visualizing the data in a user-friendly way, with compelling dashboards that tell a story about the gaming landscape.

## Technologies Used:

- ETL Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy), APIs, and orchestration tools.
- Data Warehousing: SQL, BigQuery, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalable data storage.
- Visualization: TBD (Tableau, Power BI, or custom dashboards built with Python libraries like Plotly)

## ðŸš§ Under Development ðŸš§

This portfolio is a work in progress! So far, I've completed the source ETL and data storage processes using GCP. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on data modeling and building fact and dimension tables to support robust analytics.

Check back periodically for updates as I continue refining the pipeline and adding exciting new insights. Feel free to leave feedback or share your thoughtsâ€”Iâ€™d love to hear from you! ðŸš€
